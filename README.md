# RP2040
It's a simple RP2040 board I created; it just adds a sensor directly, which is an SHCT3. I was going to add multiple other sensors, but since I had to pay for the standard at JLCPCB and it ended up being three times more expensive, I abandoned that idea and kept it simple. In the future, with what I learned, I plan to make an improved board that includes battery operation, some module like LoRa or something like that.

# Schematic and PCB:
Due to the experience I gained previously with my Macropad, it was much easier for me to make the schematic and the PCB, but I did go through many iterations until I found one that I liked.
