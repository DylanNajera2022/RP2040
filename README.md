# RP2040
It's a simple RP2040 board that I created. Initially, I was only going to add one sensor because if I wanted to add the ones I had originally planned, I would have had to pay for the standard assembly mode on JLCPBC, and that is three times more expensive. But I looked for alternatives to the sensors I wanted and ended up adding, in the end, the SHTC3, SGP40, LTR-390, and as a bonus, an addressable RGB LED. In the future, with what I've learned, I plan to make an improved board that includes battery operation or some module like LoRa or something similar.

# Schematic and PCB:
Due to the experience I gained previously with my Macropad, it was much easier for me to make the schematic and the PCB, but I did go through many iterations until I found one that I liked.
